<p class="highlighted" style="clear:both">Most likely you are accessing this website because you had some issue with
the traffic coming from this IP. This router is part of the <a href="http://torproject.org/">Tor Anonymous Network</a>, which is
dedicated to providing people with anonymity who need it most: average
computer users.</p>

<p>

While Tor is not designed for malicious computer users, it is inevitable that
some may use the network for malicious ends. In the mind of this operator,
the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant anonymous
communication trumps the risk. Tor sees use by many important segments of the
population, including whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents
skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship, abuse victims,
stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just to name a few.
