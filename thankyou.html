<h1 id="donate">Thank you! We cannot exit without your help.</h1>

<p>
 All donations will be used <b>in full</b> to cover operational costs of Tor exit nodes. If you donate more than $20 monthly, you are entitled to
 get your very own Tor exit node: Contact us and we'll set up a node carrying a name of your own choice. 
</p>
<p>
 Every donation will be listed on our site and accumulated until we can use them to purchase additional bandwidth or another node. Unless we 
 hear differently from you, we will not publish your name.
 Bandwidth stats are available (independently controlled by <a href="https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/" rel="external">TorStatus</a>), so you will be able to see what's happening with your money!

 We encourage you to <a href="contact.html#mailinglist">subscribe to our low volume mailing list</a> and follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/torservers/">Twitter</a> account.

 We are always looking for Tor friendly ISPs. If you are an ISP and are able to provide even the smallest amount of bandwidth,
 IP addresses for bridges or PI address space, please <a href="contact.html">get in contact</a>. 
</p>

 You have experience with other ISPs, or know of a good deal for high bandwidth services? Let us know.
