======  TODO  ======

We're a slowly, but healthily growing family of Tor friends. Anyone is welcome to contribute, priority on the items are basically set by individual preferences ("Hey, I started..."). Join us on irc.oftc.net #torservers.

  - Work on Todo-List, add ideas :)

===== Tech =====

==== Bridges ====

So far, we received only single requests for bridges, that's why - very unfortunately - this hasn't been high on our priority list. I think it should be put energy into

  * finding the best deals for small VPS'es in various countries with a large number of non-consecutive IPs
  * not used as exits at all, so no complaint problem there

Someone should go hunting. Also, it is probably worth to ask in various hosting forums. Often, ISPs are not antipathetic towards helping especially blocked Tor users (who usually are not the ones abusing the network), and, serving as entry node, there's no risk associated.

  * how do we set up bridge nodes that listen to a large number of IPs? https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2510
  * how do we monitor usage?
  * and, how do we keep track of who we gave the bridge IP to?

==== Exits ====

  * monitoring
  * graphs. I want combined graphs that for example show bandwidth usage across all nodes (and some usage stats, see bridges)
  * myFamily setting: currently, we have to log into EACH machine and update MyFamily if we add or remove a node. We need that centralized, but safe (signed).

==== Tor Distribution ====

I wrote a simple shell script that generates a torrent per file in Torproject's dist directory, carrying several Tor mirrors as "web seeds". Bittorrent is a nice way to circumvent filters because it uses a DHT to find other peers.

The script should be improved to create useful torrents instead of a single torrent per file. RRansom started working on a Lua script that does a proper selection, but mktorrent only supports to create torrents for either one file or one directory. Look for a different torrent creation tool that supports a selection of files, or create symbolic links to the files, run mktorrent, remove symbolic links.

Scripts and torrents can be found at https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/

So far there are no peers apart from the web mirrors. Maybe we can spread the torrents across appropriate exits and seed from there? Write a script that easily allows anyone to "torrent mirror" Tor (plus explain how to easily www mirror the dist/ directory).
===== Tor User Groups =====

One of our goals is to offer press contacts and organize local hackfests and workshops on Tor and "safe environments" for social movements in general.

  * Map/List of Contacts
  * etc.

-> [[usergroups|Tor User Groups]]
===== Website =====

  * need help on writing press releases, proposals, funding applications etc., in all languages
  * collect articles and howtos on tor for wiki
  * design: other icons, onion graphic, logo? anyone?

==== Tech ====

  * push website to github
  * enable website translations (move everything to dokuwiki? or use gettext on our simple website code?)
  * contact form with gpg encryption
  * move mailinglist; offer secure mailinglists. [[http://www.sympa.org/|sympa]] (used by riseup) or mailman?

===== Member Services =====

I want to provide secure email accounts and similar services to members, other affiliated groups, social movements, or everyone. We can still decide on who to give them to, but in general I want to have that kind of stuff documented openly in our Wiki. I know it's not really "Torservers.net" related, but remember we're the people with all the abilities to help in other areas as well.

I played with [[setup:mailserver|GPG encryption for incoming messages using Postfix]]. How would you expand that to greater scale? Is "Sieve" the better mail filtering language? How to make things like that user configurable easily?

Other useful services might be Jabber, StatusNet, hidden services hosting etc.

===== Other =====

  * t-shirts

===== Organizations to contact about Partnership/Sponsoring =====

Add! Start writing contact letters.
