====== Tor Bridge Hosting ======

We collect useful ISPs to host stable Tor bridges. Bridges are used by people behind restrictive firewalls that block access to the Tor network. They are only used as entry node to reach the Tor network, and only pass encrypted traffic between Tor clients and Tor middle nodes. As such, they will not generate abuse complaints or any trouble.

This is useful information for organizations like ours: We run private bridges that are not shared through the default pool of the Tor project, but through individual arrangements with NGOs, activist groups etc.

===== Action Request =====

It is very unlikely that any single ISP is able to offer more than ten non-consecutive IPs from different subnets. Please help us and look for cheap "unmetered" VPS with cheap pricing for extra IPs. Please collect fitting VPS/shell offers below.

**Estimated requirements: at least 256MB RAM per 10 bridges, 128 MB for a single IP bridge?**
''128MB RAM and 128MB swap seem to be enough for 10 bridges. Very tight allocation though. Better have 256MB RAM.''

Before ordering, you should ask if Tor bridges (SSL) are a good enough justification for 10 IPs. Also, if possible, order only single IPs at a time, to get IPs that are apart from each other. We will not order more than 10 IPs per IP pool, that's why we are interested in "end prices per 10 IPs" below.

===== Open Questions =====

  * how do we monitor usage?
    * how do we run a bridge authority? what benefits does that bring?
  * how do we keep track of who we gave the bridge IP to?

===== ISPs =====

To calculate "end price per IP": Take price of one VPS plus 9 extra IPs and divide by 10. ''Prices are listed per month.''

==== Comments ====

  * Amazon: Perfect for bridges because you can easily switch IPs from a large set of subnets. Unfortunately, you cannot assign more than one IP to one VM instance and traffic is fairly expensive. 30GB are free for one year!
  * BHost: "We can definitely do this, and will manually allocate your additional IPs to ensure they are not consecutive. They will all be in the same /24 though. We'd do 9 additional IPs for Â£8 + VAT per month."
  * Curvehost: "I would be able to do a deal if you pay yearly.  Additional ips are charged at $1.50/month, just request them in the notes when ordering."
  * DMEHosting: "Yes you can order a VPS with 10 IP's. However most IP's will be from the same /24 block since ARIN has strict guidelines for IP usage. For 10 IP's it would be $1.5/mo each. If you get 20 or more, it's $1/mo each."
  * Enotch: "Yes, if you would like I can create an invoice for an additional 9 IPs and process the request this way."
  * Forever Hosting: "Yes we allow 9 IP's to be ordered for our VPS."
  * Hudson Valley: "Im sorry we do not allow proxies.  This seems to be a type of proxy. "
  * Host Ladder: "I am sorry but we cannot do that for you right now. The IP's should not get blocked unless something illigal is   * OneXenVPS: "Yes we can assign you 9 additional IPs for $0.50 per IP (these will be rather consecutive or maybe from 2 ranges)."
  * NQHost: "we don't allow such traffic."
  * SemoWeb: "Go ahead and place your order and request 9 ips. The ips are $1.50 per month each."
happening."
  * ThrustVPS: "We charge $1/mo for the first 2 IP's then $3/mo after that."
  * VPSVille: "We can allocate 10 non-consecutive IPs from separate blocks for you. Choose Toronto as the location of the server for the maximum IP flexibility as we're largest in Toronto."
  * W2Interactive: "Yes you can purchase as many IPs are you need. $2/ip"

===== Non-Consecutive IPs =====

Contact support and ask if it is possible to get non-consecutive IPs.
The problem is that most requests for non-consecutive IPs come from spammers and shady Search Engine Optimizers. Most likely you will have to explain nicely that there is no abuse or other risk (eg. point them to this URL in a personal chat? - we could use a nice page that explains the concept in full).

  * shell/eggdrop/IRC bounce providers usually have cheap shell accounts and can be found on IRC to chat about it

Also, it is probably worth to ask in various hosting forums. Often, ISPs are not antipathetic towards helping especially blocked Tor users (who usually are not the ones abusing the network).

==== Example Inquiry Template ====

<file>Hi!

I am interested in your VPS offers for Tor bridge hosting. Bridges are
used by people behind restrictive firewalls that block access to the Tor
network. They are only used as entry node to reach the Tor network, and
only pass encrypted traffic between Tor clients and Tor middle nodes. As
such, they will not generate abuse complaints or any trouble.

Tor bridges use SSL, which is a good justification for IPs.

Ideally, because we distribute bridge IPs to countries which try to
block Tor bridges (and scan for near Tor bridges), the IPs need to be
non-consecutive: They should be somewhat apart, ideally from different
subnets altogether.

Can you provide VPS with these properties? I am looking for up to 100
non-consecutive IPs, so let me know how many single IPs from how many
different subnets you are able to provide.

Thanks!
