====== Tor Bridge Hosting ======

We collect useful ISPs to host stable Tor bridges. Bridges are used by people behind restrictive firewalls that block access to the Tor network. They are only used as entry node to reach the Tor network, and only pass encrypted traffic between Tor clients and Tor middle nodes. As such, they will not generate abuse complaints or any trouble.

This is useful information for organizations like ours: We run private bridges that are not shared through the default pool of the Tor project, but through individual arrangements with NGOs, activist groups etc.

===== Action Request =====

It is very unlikely that any single ISP is able to offer more than ten non-consecutive IPs from different subnets. Please help us and look for cheap "unmetered" VPS with cheap pricing for extra IPs. Please collect fitting VPS/shell offers below.

**Estimated requirements: at least 256MB RAM per 10 IPs, 128 MB per single IP bridge?**

Before ordering, you should ask if Tor bridges (SSL) are a good enough justification for 10 IPs. Also, if possible, order only single IPs at a time, to get IPs that are apart from each other. We will not order more than 10 IPs per IP pool, that's why we are interested in "end prices per 10 IPs" below.

===== ISPs =====

To calculate "end price per IP": Take price of one VPS plus 9 extra IPs and divide by 10. ''Prices are listed per month.''

===== Example Inquiry Teplate =====

<file>Hi!

I am interested in your VPS offers for Tor bridge hosting. Bridges are used by people behind restrictive firewalls that block access to the Tor network. They are only used as entry node to reach the Tor network, and only pass encrypted traffic between Tor clients and Tor middle nodes. As such, they will not generate abuse complaints or any trouble.

Tor bridges use SSL, which is a good justification for IPs.

Are you good with an order for a VPS plus 9 extra IPs?

Thanks!</file>

===== Non-Consecutive IPs =====

Contact support and ask if it is possible to get non-consecutive IPs.
The problem is that most requests for non-consecutive IPs come from spammers and shady Search Engine Optimizers. Most likely you will have to explain nicely that there is no abuse or other risk (eg. point them to this URL in a personal chat? - we could use a nice page that explains the concept in full).

  * shell/eggdrop/IRC bounce providers usually have cheap shell accounts and can be found on IRC to chat about it

Also, it is probably worth to ask in various hosting forums. Often, ISPs are not antipathetic towards helping especially blocked Tor users (who usually are not the ones abusing the network).

===== Open Questions =====

  * how do we monitor usage?
    * how do we run a bridge authority? what benefits does that bring?
  * how do we keep track of who we gave the bridge IP to?
