====== Provider Independent IP Space ======

  * [[wp>Provider-independent_address_space]]
  * would be excellent to have
  * expensive
    * http://lir.at : 1000 EUR setup, 100 EUR yearly
    * http://openpeering.nl : 650 EUR setup, 150 EUR yearly
    * http://CB3ROB.NET : even more expensive 
    * smaller nets than 256 are not routed, you have to at least use 25% of all IPs, and they all have to be routed to the same ISP -> use IPs for bridges 
    * Yes the old justification used to be for SSL'ed hosting, I think we can easily justify this, as tor is SSL, and if we have several bridges...
    * RIPE NCC charge 50€ for PI/AS issued on the same day see http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-499 We just need to find a member who doesn't want funny numbers as above.
