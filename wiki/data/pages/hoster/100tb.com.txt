We were running a high bandwidth exit node in their US Datacenter from June 2010 till January 2011 for 200$/month [[http://www.torservers.net/status/softlayer.png]] but after repeated DMCA complains they terminated our contract because of their network provider Softlayer.

Over the first few months, they told us SWIP is not possible. After
telling them for each and every single complaint that SWIP would help,
we got them to do it. They refused to add our abuse contact handle, so
it didn't help much, but still.

100tb.com did understand what service we provide (Tor exit node) and offered to provide a new server in their UK datacenter, but we didn't hear from them since dd/mm/yyyy. (Their UK datacenter is sold out.)
