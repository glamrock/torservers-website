<file>Subject: Tor Server Custom Build

Hi,

I am interested in your dedicated Gbit specials for hosting a Tor
exit. Can you give me a quote for a Dual Xeon E5620 2.4Ghz with 8GB RAM,
2x500GB RAID1 (or as small as you can get in terms of hard drives, does
not matter) and ARIN/RIPE reassignment for a subnet (/29 is enough) towards
our organization?

Thank you,

<file>Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.

About Tor: We are a soon-to-be registered non-profit from Germany
working together with security and cryptography experts on censorship
circumvention. Tor is a research project funded by the US Government
(and others) that offers encrypted and safe tunnels to those affected by
Internet censorship (China, Iran, Egypt, Burma etc). Among our partners
are Human Rights Organizations and social movements from around the globe.

Even though we only allow a number of well-known ports to exit from our
servers to not facilitate file sharing, Tor can unfortunately lead to a
number of (mostly unwarranted) abuse complaints. The Tor network and
software blocks unprotected ports such as SMTP automatically, so Tor IPs
rarely make it to blacklists.

If you like to know more about the project, feel free to contact me on
Jabber/XMPP moritz@torservers.net or visit our website at

  * before final order make sure they will really give you proper WHOIS reassignment; examples: http://www.db.ripe.net/whois?searchtext=79.140.39.227 (RIPE), http://whois.arin.net/rest/net/NET-74-120-15-144-1/ (ARIN)
  * RIPE Documentation: http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/faq/internet-resources#faq_22 , http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-489
  * ARIN Reassignment Form: https://www.arin.net/resources/templates/reassign-simple.txt (prefilled for Torservers.net: http://www.torservers.net/misc/arin-torservers.txt - ISP only needs to edit Network Section, 20-23)
