====== Torservers FAQ ======

?????? Why are we doing this? ??????

Because anonymity is important for many people. See [[http://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en|who uses Tor]].

?????? Tor Project Inc. develops Tor. Why do we need another organization? ??????

Tor Project Inc. develops Tor, but it doesn't provide Tor nodes. All nodes are contributed by volunteers, and while entry and middle nodes operate with little risk, exits provide publicly facing IP addresses, which can be connected to abuses of the network. Therefore, not many people provide exits, and that limits the available bandwidth of the network. Torservers.net aims to expand the pool of exit nodes by helping people set up their own exits and by taking care of abuse complaints and legal issues.

We also provide and distribute private bridge IPs to Tor users when regular Tor access is blocked.

?????? What are the minimal requirements for a 10mbps relay? ??????

A virtual machine with 256MB RAM might be enough, but we experienced some out of memory errors with long running nodes. If you can, upgrade to 512MB. You can also experiment with [[moblog.wiredwings.com/archives/20100427/Tor-on-Debian,-self-compiled-for-better-Performance.html|OpenSSL 1.0 and OpenBSD-Malloc]]. CPU requirements: Hard to say. If you have some idea, edit this.

?????? What are the minimal requirements for a high bandwidth relay? ??????

Tor currently does not scale on multicores. You can however run multiple Tor processes. We have good experience with running one process per CPU core. One core should be good enough for 100 Mbps. See our setup guide for details.
