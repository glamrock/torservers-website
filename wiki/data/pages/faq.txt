====== Torservers FAQ ======

?????? Why are we doing this? ??????

Because it is important.

?????? Torproject Inc. develops Tor. Why do we need another organization? ??????

While Torproject Inc. itself develops Tor, they don't provide any Tor nodes. While providing entry- and middle nodes is not a big problem, providing exits is usually connected with dealing with abuses and sometimes legal problems like prosecution for copyright infringement. Therefor not many people provide exits limiting the available exit bandwith to a minimum. Torservs.net tries to improve upon this and to help people set up exit nodes by taking care of abuses and legal stuff.
