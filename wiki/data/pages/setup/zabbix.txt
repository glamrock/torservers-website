====== Zabbix Walkthrough ======

=====  Basic Setup  =====

  * Debian  Squeeze 64bit (so we don't have to go with backports)
  * MySQL because I suppose it is easier than Postgres for most people
  * We use lighttpd, but it will run with Apache or anything else, as well

====  Install dependencies  ====

<code>
aptitude install mysql-server php5 lighttpd
</code>

Get those things up and running and we're ready to install the Zabbix Server

==== Install Zabbix ====

Zabbix is split in three components that we need. Server, Frontend and (since we als want to monitor our www Server) the Agent.

<code>
aptitude install zabbix-server-mysql

Follow Debconf Instructions
</code>

In case you chose a random password:

<code>cat /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf | grep DBPassword
</code>
You need that password to install the Frontend
<code>aptitude install zabbix-frontend-php

Follow Debconf and as DB Password give the password retrieved from zabbix Server
</code>

Now there are three things left to do:

  - Fix the DB Username and DB Name the zabbix-frontend-php installed with
  - Get it to work with our Webserver
  - Tweak some php Settings

<code>
vi /etc/zabbix/dbconfig.php
Replace the Database Name with "zabbixservermysql" and the User with "zabbix-server-my"
:q
</code>
<code>
touch /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/zabbix.conf
echo "alias.url += ( "/zabbix" => "/usr/share/zabbix" )" > /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/zabbix.conf
</code>

In case you use Apache there is a config for it in /etc/zabbix which only needs to be copied over to apaches config directory

<code>
vi /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
post_max_size = 32M
max_execution_time = 300
max_input_time = 300
Also set your php timezone
</code>

Now restart lighttpd and zabbix-server and it should be reachable with your browser.
