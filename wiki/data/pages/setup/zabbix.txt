====== Zabbix Walkthrough ======

=====  Basic Setup  =====

  * Debian  Squeeze 64bit (so we don't have to go with backports)
  * MySQL because I suppose it is easier than Postgres for most people
  * We use lighttpd, but it will run with Apache or anything else, as well

====  Install dependencies  ====

<code>
aptitude install mysql-server php5 lighttpd
</code>

Get those things up and running and we're ready to install the Zabbix Server

==== Install Zabbix Server ====

Zabbix is split in three components that we need. Server, Frontend and (since we als want to monitor our www Server) the Agent.

<code>
aptitude install zabbix-server-mysql

Follow Debconf Instructions
</code>

In case you chose a random password:

<code>cat /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf | grep DBPassword
</code>
You need that password to install the Frontend
<code>aptitude install zabbix-frontend-php

Follow Debconf and as DB Password give the password retrieved from zabbix Server
</code>

Now there are three things left to do:

  - Fix the DB Username and DB Name the zabbix-frontend-php installed with
  - Get it to work with our Webserver
  - Tweak some php Settings

<code>
vi /etc/zabbix/dbconfig.php
Replace the Database Name with "zabbixservermysql" and the User with "zabbix-server-my"
:q
</code>
<code>
touch /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/zabbix.conf
echo "alias.url += ( "/zabbix" => "/usr/share/zabbix" )" > /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/zabbix.conf
</code>

In case you use Apache there is a config for it in /etc/zabbix which only needs to be copied over to apaches config directory

<code>
vi /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
post_max_size = 32M
max_execution_time = 300
max_input_time = 300
Also set your php timezone
</code>

Now restart lighttpd and zabbix-server and it should be reachable with your browser.

==== Install Zabbix Agent ====

<code>
aptitude install zabbix-agent
</code>
<code>
vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent.conf
set Server and increase the timeout maybe
vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
set Server,
set Hostname
increase timeout if necessary
</code>

Now start zabbix-agent

==== Firewall ====

In case you use iptables you need to open port 10050 on the client side and 10050 and 10051 on the server side (or any other port of course if you configured Zabbix to use non-standard ports). As an alternative you can also use Active Checks which don't require open Ports on the Nodes that are to be monitored and also help to reduce load on the Server side, since the Client does all the work itself in this case.

===== Advanced =====

==== Custom Scripts ====

=== md ===

Here is a small script for monitoring md. It can only monitor Raid1 systems so far, since we don't have the need to monitor Raid5 or anything else. Feel free to expand this in case you need it.

<code>
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ];
then
echo "Usage: $0 "
exit
fi
var_mdnum="$1"
if [[ "$var_mdnum" != md* ]]
then
var_mdnum=`echo $var_mdnum | sed 's/\/[a-z]*\/md*/md/'`
fi
if [ `cat /proc/mdstat | grep -C 1 $var_mdnum | grep -o UU` == "UU" ]
then
echo 0
exit
else
echo 1
exit
fi
</code>

Put something like

<code>UserParameter=raid.md0.status, /etc/zabbix/scripts/get_md_status.sh md0</code>
in your zabbix_agentd.conf to use this and configure an Item for it on the Zabbix Server for the node you wish to use this for or in its underlying template.
