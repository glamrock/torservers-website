<h2>Tor Exit Node Hosting</h2>

<p>
 Without our servers, roughly 25% of all exit traffic in the Tor network passes through <i>one</i> node, which is far from ideal. 
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00072.html" rel="external">The currently fastest node, Blutmagie, will be shut down within the next months</a>, and the whole network will suffer heavily.
 We run a high bandwidth Tor exit node - one of the fastest nodes in existence - and several smaller nodes. This helps to make the Tor network more stable, faster and more anonymous. 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Does your company care for privacy and uncensored access to Internet (people in China and Iran need Tor!)? 
  We can put up a banner on the node's website to show it does. We can also name the node and its DNS entry after your chosing. For as little as $20 monthly, 
  you can get your own node hosted with us!

<h2>Private Bridge IP addresses</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en">Bridges</a> can be used to access the Tor network if public entry nodes are blocked. 
 The Tor website offers a limited number of bridge addresses, but they might get blocked fast (which is happening in China, for example), 
 or monitored to track down its users.
</p>
<p> 
 We can provide exclusive private bridge IP addresses to individuals or organizations at prices starting
 from $1 per month and IP. You can also donate so we can provide free bridge IPs to those who need them. We work together with Torproject and
 other organizations to get them to the people. If you are an organization able to distribute bridge IPs locally, contact us!
</p>

<h2>Hidden Services &amp; Eepsite Hosting</h2>
<p>
 In the future, we want to provide preconfigured, disk encrypted space for <a href="http://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">Tor hidden services</a> and <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/faq.html#eepsite">I2P eepsite</a> hosting.
 <br/>For this, we use a separate server: Our exit nodes will always stay clean to not risk their operation.
