<h2 id="exits">Tor Exit Node Hosting</h2>

<p>
 Without our servers, roughly 25% of all exit traffic in the Tor network passes through <i>one</i> node, which is far from ideal. 
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00072.html" rel="external">The currently fastest node, Blutmagie, will be shut down within the next months</a>, and the whole network and its users will suffer.
 We run high bandwidth Tor exit nodes - some of the fastest nodes in existence - and several small nodes. This helps to make the Tor network more stable, faster and more anonymous.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Does your company care for privacy and uncensored access to Internet (people in China and Iran need Tor!)? 
  We can put up a banner on the node's website to show it does. We can also name the node and its DNS entry after your chosing. For as little as $20 monthly,  you can get your own node hosted with us.
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="/wiki/">Read and edit our Wiki</a>. We collect information on censorship circumention, Tor guides, and more.
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="contact.html#mailinglist">Join our mailing list</a> and browse the archives.
  <br/>We use it to discuss details like node configuration and extra services for participants and to design our plans together,
  and keep you up to date in regard to abuse complaints.

<h2 id="bridges">Private Bridge IP addresses</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en">Bridges</a> can be used to access the Tor network if public entry nodes are blocked. 
 The Tor website offers a limited number of bridge addresses, but they might get blocked fast (which is happening in China, for example), or monitored to track down its users.
</p>
<p> 
 <div class="info">Thanks to funding by Access Now and others, we can provide exclusive free private bridge IP addresses to individuals and organizations.</div> 
 <a href="https://privacybox.de/torservers.msg">To apply, drop us an anonymous mail</a>. Tell us as many details as possible (no names required), and don't forget to include how we can reach you.
</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hidden Services &amp; Eepsite Hosting</h2>
<p>
 In the future, we want to provide preconfigured, disk encrypted space for <a href="http://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">Tor hidden services</a> and <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/faq.html#eepsite">I2P eepsite</a> hosting.
 <br/>For this, we use separate servers: Our exit nodes will always stay clean to not risk their operation.
